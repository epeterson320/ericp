    Good morning, Kiera, and if you're reading this, it means one of two things: either you
    figured out how to use the candle to heat the paper and read the secret message, or
    you took too long and were alerted by...well I'm getting ahead of myself.
  </p>
  <p>
    A very happy 33rd birthday to you, love! And hopefully, this mystery will put a smile on
    your face as I try to challenge your wit! By now, you've likely noticed I took your phone,
    so I assume you're reading this on the laptop. If you can follow the clues, you'll be able
    to find us! The girls and I are waiting for you. Are you ready for your first clue? Forgive
    me, but it's a haiku.
